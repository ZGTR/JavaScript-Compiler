# JavaScript Compiler

<strong>Brief</strong>
<br/>This is a cool, mini JavaScript compiler I did back in 2012. I'm still in love of the way I did it and how it parsed the end programming code. It's magic!
<br/>Using Javacc, I've assembled the tokens, the grammar, the parsing tree and then the execusion. I have also tackled OOP and arrays on this one. 

<strong>Code and Comments</strong>
<br/>To be honest, the code is self explanatory. Reading it now (xD) is pretty easy for me to remember everything I did back then. I hope (xD) that it's easy for you too.

<strong>Heirarchy</strong>
<br/>If you look at the JJTree folder you can figure out what this compiler supports and how to do them. It supports some easy syntax (like expressions, assignments, loops, ..etc) while also has the ability to handle much higher complex stuff (functions, objects declarations and calling, arrays, arrays of objects)

<strong>Tests</strong>
I've included some of the tests the compiler passed in the tests folder. You can see how each testcase heighlight one or more syntax problem and how it's solved in code.

<strong>Disclaimer</strong>
<br/>This is a lightweight compiler I coded alone in 3 days after the VisualBasic Compiler. So, it's not in a super polished state, but you can take the ideas I have done here further.
<br/>Happy compiling.
